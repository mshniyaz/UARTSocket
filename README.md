# Websocket UART

So we have been facing this issue where we want to pipe uart data over the web from a host PC. Meaning host PC connects to uart, creates a server of uart data, and serve it over the network to another client PC to access and treat it as if it's a uart port. 

We have done it using reverse ssh method, but we would like to have another method using web sockets. Could u work on it using web sockets?
